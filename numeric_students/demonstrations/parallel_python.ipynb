    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)):\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"In computer science, a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.[1] The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. Multiple threads can exist within one process, executing concurrently and sharing resources such as memory, while different processes do not share these resources. In particular, the threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its variables at any given time.\"\n",

    "### Python global intepreter lock\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Motivation: python objects (lists, dicts, sets, etc.) manage their own memory by storing a counter that keeps track of how many copies of an object are in use.  Memory is reclaimed when that counter goes to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Having a globally available reference count makes it simple for Python extensions to create, modify and share python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To avoid memory corruption, a python process will only allow 1 thread at any given moment to run python code.  Any thread that wants to access python objects in that process needs to acquire the global interpreter lock (GIL).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A python extension written in C, C++ or numba is free to release the GIL, provided it doesn't create, destroy or modify any python objects.  For example: numpy, pandas, scipy.ndimage, scipy.integrate.quadrature all release the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Many python standard library input/output routines (file reading, networking) also release the GIL\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On the other hand:  hdf5, and therefore h5py and netCDF4, don't release the GIL and are single threaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python comes with many libraries to manage both processes and threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "If multiple threads are present in a python process, the python intepreter releases the GIL at specified intervals (5 miliseconds default) to allow them to execute:"
