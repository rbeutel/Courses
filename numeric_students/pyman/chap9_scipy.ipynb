    "# Numerical Routines: SciPy and NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy is a Python library of mathematical routines. Many of the SciPy\n",
    "routines are Python \"wrappers\", that is, Python routines that provide a\n",
    "Python interface for numerical libraries and routines originally written\n",
    "in Fortran, C, or C++. Thus, SciPy lets you take advantage of the\n",
    "decades of work that has gone into creating and optimizing numerical\n",
    "routines for science and engineering. Because the Fortran, C, or C++\n",
    "code that Python accesses is compiled, these routines typically run very\n",

    "solved. The next two, `a` and `b` are the $x$ values that bracket the\n",
    "solution you are looking for. You should choose `a` and `b` so that\n",
    "there is only one solutions in the interval between `a` and `b`. Brent's\n",
    "method also requires that `f(a)` and `f(b)` have opposite signs; an\n",
    "error message is returned if they do not. Thus to find the three\n",
    "solutions to $\\tan x - \\sqrt{(8/x)^2-1} = 0$, we need to run\n",

    "of a single variable. It has an implementation of the Newton-Raphson\n",
    "method called `scipy.optimize.newton`. It's the racecar of such methods;\n",
    "its super fast but less stable that the Brent method. To fully realize\n",
    "its speed, you need to specify not only the function to be solved, but\n",
    "also its first derivative, which is often more trouble than its worth.\n",
    "You can also specify its second derivative, which may further speed up\n",
    "finding the solution. If you do not specify the first or second\n",
    "derivatives, the method uses the secant method, which is usually slower\n",

    "Nevertheless, SciPy provides quite an assortment of numerical solvers\n",
