    "between upper and lower case letters. Thus, two words spelled the same\n",

    "pair: IPython; magic functions\n",
    "\n",
    "IPython features a number of commands called \"magic\" commands that let\n",

    "provided there is no ambiguity in how to finish the command. In the\n",
    "present case, that would mean that there was no other subdirectory\n",

    "into the IPython terminal. Try it out! It will make your life more\n",
    "wonderful.\n",
    "\n",
    "A related shortcut involves the $\\uparrow$ key. If you type a command,\n",
    "say `cd` and then to press the $\\uparrow$ key, IPython will complete the\n",
    "`cd` command with the last instance of that command. Thus, when you\n",
    "launch IPython, you can use this shortcut to take you to the directory\n",
    "you used when you last ran IPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also simply press the $\\uparrow$ key, which will simply recall\n",
    "the most recent command. Repeated application of the $\\uparrow$ key\n",

    "$2^{31}-1=2147483647$. One bit is used to store the sign of the integer\n",

    "number is automatically treated as an integer if is written without a\n",
    "decimal point and it is within the bounds given above. This means that\n",
    "`23`, written without a decimal point, is an integer and `23.`, written\n",
    "with a decimal point, is a floating point number. If an integer extends\n",
    "beyond the bounds of a simple integer, the it becomes a **long\n",
    "integer**, and is designated as such by an `L` following the last digit.\n",
    "Here are some examples of integer arithmetic:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the binary operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `//`, the output is an\n",
    "integer if the inputs are integers. The only exception is if the result\n",

    "single: line continuation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Line continuation\n",
    "\n",
    "From time to time, a line of code in a script will be unusually long,\n",
    "which can make the code difficult to read. In such cases, it is\n",
    "advisable to split the code onto several lines. For example, line 7 in\n",
    "the preceding script could be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "dr = np.sqrt( (x2-x1)**2 \n",
    "            + (y2-y1)**2 \n",
    "            + (z2-z1)**2 )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can generally continue an expression on another line in Python for\n",
    "code that is within a function argument, as it is here where the line is\n",
    "split inside the argument of the square root function. Note that the\n",
    "sub-expressions written on different lines are lined up. This is done\n",
    "solely to improve readability; Python does not require it. Nevertheless,\n",
    "as the whole point of splitting a line is to improve readability, it's\n",
    "best to line up expressions so as to maximize readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can split any Python line inside of parentheses, brackets, and\n",
    "braces, as illustrated above. You can split it other places as well by\n",
    "using the backslash (`\\`) character. For example, the code\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "a = 1 + 2 \\\n",
    "  + 3 + 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is equivalent to\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So you can use backslash character (`\\`) of explicit line continuation\n",
    "when implicit line continuation won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing Modules\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "single: module; importing\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in Example 2 in the last section that we needed to import the\n",
    "NumPy module in order to use the `sqrt` function. Indeed the NumPy\n",
    "library contains many useful functions, some of which are listed in\n",
    "section `chap2:NumPyFuncs`. Whenever any NumPy functions are used, the\n",
    "NumPy library must be loaded using an `import` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few ways to do this. The one we generally recommend is to\n",
    "use the `import as` implementation that we used in Example 2. For the\n",
    "main NumPy and MatPlotLib libraries, this is implemented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import maplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These statements import the entire library named in the `import`\n",
    "statement and associate a prefix with the imported library: `np` and\n",
    "`plt` in the above examples. Functions from within these libraries are\n",
    "then called by attaching the appropriate prefix with a period *before*\n",
    "the function name. Thus, the functions `sqrt` or `sin` from the NumPy\n",
    "library are called using the syntax `np.sqrt` or `np.sin`; the functions\n",
    "`plot` or `xlabel` from the `maplotlib.pyplot` would be called using\n",
    "`plt.plot` or `plt.xlabel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the NumPy and MatPlotLib libraries can be called simply\n",
    "by writing\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy\n",
    "import maplotlib.pyplot\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When loaded this way, the `sqrt` function would be called as\n",
    "`numpy.sqrt` and the `plot` function would be called as\n",
    "`MatPlotLib.pyplot.plot`. The `import as` syntax allows you to define\n",
    "nicknames for `numpy` and `maplotlib.pyplot`. Nearly any nickname can be\n",
    "chosen, but the Python community has settled on the nicknames `np` and\n",
    "`plt` for `numpy` and `maplotlib.pyplot`, so you are advised to stick\n",
    "with those. Using the standard nicknames makes your code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also import a single functions or subset of functions from a\n",
    "module without importing the entire module. For example, suppose you\n",
    "wanted to import just the natural log function `log` from NumPy. You\n",
    "could write\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from numpy import log\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the `log` function in a script, you would write\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "a = log(5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which would assign the value `1.6094379124341003` to the variable `a`.\n",
    "If you wanted to import the three functions, `log`, `sin`, and `cos`,\n",
    "you would write\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "from numpy import log, sin, cos\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and would similarly use them without an \"`np.`\" prefix. In general, we\n",
    "do not recommend using the the `from` *module* `import ...` way of\n",
    "importing functions. When reading code, it makes it harder to determine\n",
    "from which modules functions are imported, and can lead to clashes\n",
    "between similarly named functions from different modules. Nevertheless,\n",
    "you will see the form used in programs you encounter on the web and\n",
    "elsewhere so it is important to understand the syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting help: documentation in IPython shell\n",
    "--------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Help is never far away when you are running the IPython shell. To obtain\n",
    "information on any valid Python or NumPy function, and many MatPlotLib\n",
    "functions, simply type `help(` *function* `)`, as illustrated here\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [1]: help(range)\n",
    "range([start,] stop[, step]) -> list of integers\n",

    "to 0.  When step is given, it specifies the increment (or\n",
    "decrement).  For example, range(4) returns [0, 1, 2, 3].  The\n",
    "end point is omitted! These are exactly the valid indices for a\n",
    "list of 4 elements.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the information provided can be quite extensive and you might\n",
    "find it useful to clear the IPython window with the `clear` command so\n",
    "you can easily scroll back to find the beginning of the documentation.\n",
    "You may have also noticed that when you type the name of a function plus\n",
    "the opening parenthesis, IPython displays a window showing the first\n",
    "dozen lines or so of the documentation on that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is a detail-oriented activity\n",
    "-----------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have a little experience with Python and computer\n",

    "\n",
    "This raises a second point: sometimes your code will run but give the\n",
    "wrong answer because of a programming error or because of a more subtle\n",
    "error in your algorithm. For this reason, it is important to test your\n",
    "code to make sure it is behaving properly. Test it to make sure it gives\n",

    "or where you have some independent means of checking it. Test it in\n",
    "limiting cases, that is, for cases that are at the extremes of the sets\n",
