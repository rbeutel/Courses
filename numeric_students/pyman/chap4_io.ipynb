    "A good relationship depends on good communication. In this chapter you\n",
    "learn how to communicate with Python. Of course, communicating is a\n",
    "two-way street: input and output. Generally, when you have Python\n",
    "perform some task, you need to feed it information---input. When it is\n",
    "done with that task, it reports back to you the results of its\n",
    "calculations---output.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two venues for input that concern us: the computer keyboard\n",
    "and the input data file. Similarly, there are two venues for output: the\n",
    "computer screen and the output data file. We start with input from the\n",
    "keyboard and output to the computer screen. Then we deal with data file\n",
    "input and output---or \"io.\"\n",

    "Keyboard input\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Many computer programs need input from the user. In `chap2:ScriptExmp1`,\n",
    "the program needed the distance traveled as an input in order to\n",
    "determine the duration of the trip and the cost of the gasoline. As you\n",
    "might like to use this same script to determine the cost of several\n",
    "different trips, it would be useful if the program requested that input\n",
    "when it was run from the IPython shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a function called `raw_input` (renamed `input` in Python 3)\n",
    "for getting input from the user and assigning it a variable name. It has\n",
    "the form\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "strname = raw_input(\"prompt to user\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the `raw_input` statement is executed, it prints the text in the\n",
    "quotes to the computer screen and waits for input from the user. The\n",
    "user types a string of characters and presses the return key. The\n",
    "`raw_input` function then assigns that string to the variable name on\n",
    "the right of the assignment operator `=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try it out this snippet of code in the IPython shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [1]: distance = raw_input(\"Input distance of trip in miles: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "Input distance of trip in miles: \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python prints out the string argument of the `raw_input` function and\n",
    "waits for a response from you. Let's go ahead and type `450` for \"450\n",
    "miles\" and press return. Now type the variable name `distance` to see\n",
    "its value\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [2]: distance\n",
    "Out[2]: u'450'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the `distance` is `450` as expected, but it is a string\n",
    "(the `u` stands for \"unicode\" which refers to the string coding system\n",
    "Python uses). Because we want to use `450` as a number and not a\n",
    "distance, we need to convert it from a string to a number. We can do\n",
    "that with the `eval` function by writing\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [3]: distance = eval(distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: distance\n",
    "Out[4]: 450\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `eval` function has converted `distance` to an integer. This is fine\n",
    "and we are ready to move on. However, we might prefer that `distance` be\n",
    "a float instead of an integer. There are two ways to do this. We could\n",
    "assume the user is very smart and will type \"`450.`\" instead of \"`450`\",\n",
    "which will cause distance to be a float when `eval` does the conversion.\n",
    "That is, the number 450 is dynamically typed to be a float or an integer\n",
    "depending on whether or not the user uses a decimal point.\n",
    "Alternatively, we could use the function `float` in place of `eval`,\n",
    "which would ensure that `distance` is a floating point variable. Thus,\n",
    "our code would look like this (including the user response):\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [5]: distance = raw_input(\"Input distance of trip in miles: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "Input distance of trip in miles: 450\n",

    "\n",
    "In [8]: distance\n",
    "Out[8]: 450.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's incorporate what we have learned into the code we wrote for\n",
    "`chap2:ScriptExmp1`\n",

    "Whether you use `float` or `int` or `eval` depends on whether you want a\n",
    "float, an integer, or a dynamically typed variable. In this program, it\n",
    "doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can simply run the program and then type `time`, `gallons`, and\n",
    "`cost` to view the results of the calculations done by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to output, we note that sometimes you may want string\n",
    "input rather that numerical input. For example, you might want the user\n",

    "\n",
    "It would be much more convenient if the program in the previous section\n",
    "would simply write its output to the computer screen, instead of\n",
    "requiring the user to type `time`, `gallons`, and `cost` to view the\n",
    "results. Fortunately, this can be accomplished very simply using\n",
    "Python's `print` function. For example, simply including the statement\n",
    "`print(time, gallons, cost)` after line 12, running the program would\n",
    "give the following result:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The program prints out the results as a tuple of time (in hours),\n",
    "gasoline used (in gallons), and cost (in dollars). Of course, the\n",

    "\n",
    "### Formatting output with `str.format()`\n",
    "\n",
    "We can clean up the output of the example above and make it considerably\n",
