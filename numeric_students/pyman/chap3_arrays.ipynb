    "# Strings, Lists, Arrays, and Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The most import data structure for scientific computing in Python is the\n",
    "**NumPy array**. NumPy arrays are used to store lists of numerical data\n",
    "and to represent vectors, matrices, and even tensors. NumPy arrays are\n",
    "designed to handle large data sets efficiently and with a minimum of\n",
    "fuss. The NumPy library has a large set of routines for creating,\n",
    "manipulating, and transforming NumPy arrays. NumPy functions, like\n",
    "`sqrt` and `sin`, are designed specifically to work with NumPy arrays.\n",
    "Core Python has an array data structure, but it's not nearly as\n",
    "versatile, efficient, or useful as the NumPy array. We will not be using\n",
    "Python arrays at all. Therefore, whenever we refer to an \"array,\" we\n",
    "mean a \"NumPy array.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists** are another data structure, similar to NumPy arrays, but\n",
    "unlike NumPy arrays, lists are a part of core Python. Lists have a\n",
    "variety of uses. They are useful, for example, in various bookkeeping\n",
    "tasks that arise in computer programming. Like arrays, they are\n",
    "sometimes used to store data. However, lists do not have the specialized\n",
    "properties and tools that make arrays so powerful for scientific\n",
    "computing. So in general, we prefer arrays to lists for working with\n",
    "scientific data. For other tasks, lists work just fine and can even be\n",
    "preferable to arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** are lists of keyboard characters as well as other characters\n",
    "not on your keyboard. They are not particularly interesting in\n",
    "scientific computing, but they are nevertheless necessary and useful.\n",
    "Texts on programming with Python typically devote a good deal of time\n",
    "and space to learning about strings and how to manipulate them. Our uses\n",
    "of them are rather modest, however, so we take a minimalist's approach\n",
    "and only introduce a few of their features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries** are like lists, but the elements of dictionaries are\n",
    "accessed in a different way than for lists. The elements of lists and\n",
    "arrays are numbered consecutively, and to access an element of a list or\n",
    "an array, you simply refer to the number corresponding to its position\n",
    "in the sequence. The elements of dictionaries are accessed by \"keys\",\n",
    "which can be either strings or (arbitrary) integers (in no particular\n",
    "order). Dictionaries are an important part of core Python. However, we\n",
    "do not make much use of them in this introduction to scientific Python,\n",
    "so our discussion of them is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are lists of characters. Any character that you can type from a\n",
    "computer keyboard, plus a variety of other characters, can be elements\n",
    "in a string. Strings are created by enclosing a sequence of characters\n",
    "within a pair of single or double quotes. Examples of strings include\n",
    "`\"Marylyn\"`, `\"omg\"`, `\"good_bad_#5f>!\"`, `\"{0:0.8g}\"`, and\n",
    "`\"We hold these truths ...\"`. Caution: the quotes defining a given\n",
    "string must *both* be single or *both* be double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can be assigned variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [1]: a = \"My dog's name is\"\n",
    "In [2]: b = \"Bingo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can be concatenated using the \"`+`\" operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [3]: c = a + \" \" + b\n",
    "In [4]: c\n",
    "Out[4]: \"My dog's name is Bingo\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In forming the string `c`, we concatenated *three* strings, `a`, `b`,\n",
    "and a *string literal*, in this case a space `\" \"`, which is needed to\n",
    "provide a space to separate string `a` from `b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use strings for different purposes: labeling data in data\n",
    "files, labeling axes in plots, formatting numerical output, requesting\n",
    "input for your programs, as arguments in functions, *etc*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because numbers---digits---are also alpha numeric characters, strings\n",
    "can be made up of numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [5]: d = \"927\"\n",
    "In [6]: e = 927\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable `d` is a string while the variable `e` is an integer. What\n",
    "do you think happens if you try to add them by writing `d+e`? Try it out\n",
    "and see if you understand the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: list\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two data structures, *lists* and *tuples*, that consist of a\n",
    "list of one or more elements. The elements of lists or tuples can be\n",
    "numbers or strings, or both. Lists (we will discuss tuples later) are\n",
    "defined by a pair of *square* brackets on either end with individual\n",
    "elements separated by commas. Here are two examples of lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [1]: a = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]\n",
    "In [2]: b = [5., \"girl\", 2+0j, \"horse\", 21]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access individual elements of a list using the variable name for\n",
    "the list with square brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [3]: b[0]\n",
    "Out[3]: 5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: b[1]\n",
    "Out[4]: 'girl'\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: b[2]\n",
    "Out[5]: (2+0j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element of `b` is `b[0]`, the second is `b[1]`, the third is\n",
    "`b[2]`, and so on. Some computer languages index lists starting with 0,\n",
    "like Python and C, while others index lists (or things more-or-less\n",
    "equivalent) starting with 1 (like Fortran and Matlab). It's important to\n",
    "keep in mind that Python uses the former convention: lists are\n",
    "*zero-indexed*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last element of this array is `b[4]`, because `b` has 5 elements.\n",
    "The last element can also be accessed as `b[-1]`, no matter how many\n",
    "elements `b` has, and the next-to-last element of the list is `b[-2]`,\n",
    "*etc*. Try it out:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [6]: b[4]\n",
    "Out[6]: 21\n",
    "\n",
    "In [7]: b[-1]\n",
    "Out[7]: 21\n",
    "\n",
    "In [8]: b[-2]\n",
    "Out[8]: 'horse'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual elements of lists can be changed. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [9]: b\n",
    "Out[9]: [5.0, 'girl', (2+0j), 'horse', 21]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [10]: b[0] = b[0]+2\n",
    "\n",
    "In [11]: b[3] = 3.14159\n",
    "\n",
    "In [12]: b\n",
    "Out[12]: [7.0, 'girl', (2+0j), 3.14159, 21]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see that 2 was added to the previous value of `b[0]` and the\n",
    "string `'horse'` was replaced by the floating point number `3.14159`. We\n",
    "can also manipulate individual elements that are strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [13]: b[1] = b[1] + \"s & boys\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In [14]: b\n",
    "Out[14]: [10.0, 'girls & boys', (2+0j), 3.14159, 21]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also add lists, but the result might surprise you:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [15]: a\n",
    "Out[15]: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [16]: a+a\n",
    "Out[16]: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [17]: a+b\n",
    "Out[17]: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 10.0, 'girls & boys', (2+0j),\n",
    "          3.14159, 21]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding lists concatenates them, just as the \"`+`\" operator concatenates\n",
    "strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicing lists\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access pieces of lists using the *slicing* feature of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [18]: b\n",
    "Out[18]: [10.0, 'girls & boys', (2+0j), 3.14159, 21]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [19]: b[1:4]\n",
    "Out[19]: ['girls & boys', (2+0j), 3.14159]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [20]: b[3:5]\n",
    "Out[20]: [3.14159, 21]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You access a subset of a list by specifying two indices separated by a\n",
    "colon \"`:`\". This is a powerful feature of lists that we will use often.\n",
    "Here are a few other useful slicing shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [21]: b[2:]\n",
    "Out[21]: [(2+0j), 3.14159, 21]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [22]: b[:3]\n",
    "Out[22]: [10.0, 'girls & boys', (2+0j)]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [23]: b[:]\n",
    "Out[23]: [10.0, 'girls & boys', (2+0j), 3.14159, 21]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the left slice index is `0`, you can leave it out; similarly,\n",
    "if the right slice index is the length of the list, you can leave it out\n",
    "also.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does the following slice of an array give you?\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [24]: b[1:-1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the length of a list using Python's `len` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [25]: len(b)\n",
    "Out[25]: 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and modifying lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has functions for creating and augmenting lists. The most useful\n",
    "is the `range` function, which can be used to create a uniformly spaced\n",
    "sequence of integers. The general form of the function is\n",
    "`range([start,] stop[, step])`, where the arguments are all integers;\n",
    "those in square brackets are optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [26]: range(10)      # makes a list of 10 integers from 0 to 9\n",
    "Out[26]: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [27]: range(3,10)    # makes a list of 10 integers from 3 to 9\n",
    "Out[27]: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [28]: range(0,10,2)  # makes a list of 10 integers from 0 to 9\n",
    "                        # with increment 2\n",
    "Out[28]: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add one or more elements to the beginning or end of a list using\n",
    "the \"`+`\" operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [29]: a = range(1,10,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [30]: a\n",
    "Out[30]: [1, 4, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [31]: a += [16, 31, 64, 127]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [32]: a\n",
    "Out[32]: [1, 4, 7, 16, 31, 64, 127]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [33]: a = [0, 0] + a\n",
    "\n",
    "In [34]: a\n",
    "Out[34]: [0, 0, 1, 4, 7, 16, 31, 64, 127]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can insert elements into a list using slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [35]: b = a[:5] + [101, 102] + a[5:]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [36]: b\n",
    "Out[36]: [0, 1, 1, 4, 7, 101, 102, 16, 31, 64, 127]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a word about tuples: tuples are lists that are *immutable*.\n",
    "That is, once defined, the individual elements of a tuple cannot be\n",
    "changed. Whereas a list is written as a sequence of numbers enclosed in\n",
    "*square* brackets, a tuple is written as a sequence of numbers enclosed\n",
    "in *round* parentheses. Individual elements of a tuple are addressed in\n",
    "the same way as individual elements of lists are addressed, but those\n",
    "individual elements cannot be changed. All of this illustrated by this\n",
    "simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [37]: c = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)\n",
    "In [37]: c[4]\n",
    "Out[38]: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "In [39]: c[4] = 7\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we tried to change `c[4]`, the system returned an error because we\n",
    "are prohibited from changing an element of a tuple. Tuples offer some\n",
    "degree of safety when we want to define lists of immutable constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multidimensional lists and tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make multidimensional lists, or lists of lists. Consider,\n",
    "for example, a list of three elements, where each element in the list is\n",
    "itself a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [40]: a = [[3, 9], [8, 5], [11, 1]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a three-element list where each element consists of a\n",
    "two-element list. Such constructs can be useful in making tables and\n",
    "other structures. They also become relevant later on in our discussion\n",
    "of NumPy arrays and matrices, which we introduce below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the various elements of a list with a straightforward\n",
    "extension of the indexing scheme we have been using. The first element\n",
    "of the list `a` above is `a[0]`, which is `[3, 9]`; the second is\n",
    "`a[1]`, which is `[8, 5]`. The first element of `a[1]` is accessed as\n",
    "`a[1][0]`, which is 8, as illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [41]: a[0]\n",
    "Out[41]: [3, 9]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [42]: a[1]\n",
    "Out[42]: [8, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [43]: a[1][0]\n",
    "Out[43]: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "In [44]: a[2][1]\n",
    "Out[44]: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional tuples work exactly like multidimensional lists, except\n",
    "they are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: NumPy; array\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The NumPy array is the real workhorse of data structures for scientific\n",
    "and engineering applications. The NumPy array, formally called `ndarray`\n",
    "in NumPy documentation, is similar to a list but where all the elements\n",
    "of the list are of the same type. The elements of a NumPy array, or\n",
    "simply an *array*, are usually numbers, but can also be boolians,\n",
    "strings, or other objects. When the elements are numbers, they must all\n",
    "be of the same type. For example, they might be all integers or all\n",
    "floating point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating arrays (1-d)\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy has a number of functions for creating arrays. We focus on four\n",
    "(or five or six, depending on how you count!). The **first** of these,\n",
    "the `array` function, converts a list to an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [1]: a = [0, 0, 1, 4, 7, 16, 31, 64, 127]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [2]: b = array(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [3]: b\n",
    "Out[3]: array([  0,  0,  1,  4,  7, 16, 31, 64, 127])\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4]: c = array([1, 4., -2, 7])\n",
    "\n",
    "In [5]: c\n",
    "Out[5]: array([ 1., 4., -2., 7.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that `b` is an integer array, as it was created from a list of\n",
    "integers. On the other hand, `c` is a floating point array even though\n",
    "only one of the elements of the list from which it was made was a\n",
    "floating point number. The `array` function automatically promotes all\n",
    "of the numbers to the type of the most general entry in the list, which\n",
    "in this case is a floating point number. In the case that elements of\n",
    "the list is made up of numbers and strings, all the elements become\n",
    "strings when an array is formed from a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **second** way arrays can be created is using the NumPy `linspace`\n",
    "or `logspace` functions. The `linspace` function creates an array of $N$\n",
    "evenly spaced points between a starting point and an ending point. The\n",
    "form of the function is `linspace(start, stop, N)`. If the third\n",
    "argument `N` is omitted, then `N=50`.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [6]: linspace(0, 10, 5)\n",
    "Out[6]: array([  0. ,  2.5,  5. ,  7.5, 10. ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `linspace` function produced 5 evenly spaced points between 0 and 10\n",
    "inclusive. NumPy also has a closely related function `logspace` that\n",
    "produces evenly spaced points on a logarithmically spaced scale. The\n",
    "arguments are the same as those for `linspace` except that `start` and\n",
    "`stop` refer to a power of 10. That is, the array starts at\n",
    "$10^{\\mathrm{start}}$ and ends at $10^{\\mathrm{stop}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [7]: %precision 1       # display only 1 digit after decimal\n",
    "Out[7]: u'%.1f'\n",
    "\n",
    "In [8]: logspace(1, 3, 5)\n",
    "Out[8]: array([   10. ,   31.6,  100. ,  316.2, 1000. ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logspace` function created an array with 5 points evenly spaced on\n",
    "a logarithmic axis starting at $10^1$ and ending at $10^3$. The\n",
    "`logspace` function is particularly useful when you want to create a\n",
    "log-log plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **third** way arrays can be created is using the NumPy `arange`\n",
    "function, which is similar to the Python `range` function for creating\n",
    "lists. The form of the function is `arange(start, stop, step)`. If the\n",
    "third argument is omitted `step=1`. If the first and third arguments are\n",
    "omitted, then `start=0` and `step=1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [9]: arange(0, 10, 2)\n",
    "Out[9]: array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])\n",
    "\n",
    "In [10]: arange(0., 10, 2)\n",
    "Out[10]: array([ 0., 2., 4., 6., 8.])\n",
    "\n",
    "In [11]: arange(0, 10, 1.5)\n",
    "Out[11]: array([ 0. , 1.5, 3. , 4.5, 6. , 7.5, 9. ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `arange` function produces points evenly spaced between 0 and 10\n",
    "exclusive of the final point. Notice that `arange` produces an integer\n",
    "array in the first case but a floating point array in the other two\n",
    "cases. In general `arange` produces an integer array if the arguments\n",
    "are all integers; making any one of the arguments a float causes the\n",
    "array that is created to be a float.\n",

    "\n",
    "So far we have examined only one-dimensional NumPy arrays, that is,\n",

    "series of rows and columns of numbers. Matrices can be represented using\n",
    "two-dimensional NumPy arrays. Higher dimension arrays can also be\n",
    "created as the application demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating NumPy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways of creating multidimensional NumPy arrays.\n",
    "The most straightforward way is to convert a list to an array using\n",
    "NumPy's `array` function, which we demonstrate here:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [51]: b = array([[1., 4, 5], [9, 7, 4]])\n",
    "\n",
    "In [52]: b\n",
    "Out[52]: array([[1., 4., 5.],\n",
    "                [9., 7., 4.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the syntax used above in which two one-dimensional lists\n",
    "`[1., 4, 5]` and `[9, 7, 4]` are enclosed in square brackets to make a\n",
    "two-dimensional list. The `array` function converts the two-dimensional\n",
    "list, a structure we introduced earlier, to a two-dimensional array.\n",
    "When it makes the conversion from a list to an array, the array function\n",
    "makes all the elements have the same data type as the most complex\n",
    "entry, in this case a float. This points out an important difference\n",
    "between NumPy arrays and lists: all elements of a NumPy array must be of\n",
    "the same data type: floats, or integers, or complex numbers, *etc*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of other functions for creating arrays. For example,\n",
    "a 3 row by 4 column array or $3 \\times 4$ array with all the elements\n",
    "filled with 1 can be created using the `ones` function introduced\n",
    "earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [53]: a = ones((3,4), dtype=float)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [54]: a\n",
    "Out[54]: array([[ 1., 1., 1., 1.],\n",
    "                [ 1., 1., 1., 1.],\n",
    "                [ 1., 1., 1., 1.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a tuple to specify the size of the array in the first argument of\n",
    "the `ones` function creates a multidimensional array, in this case a\n",
    "two-dimensional array with the two elements of the tuple specifying the\n",
    "number of rows and columns, respectively. The `zeros` function can be\n",
    "used in the same way to create a matrix or other multidimensional array\n",
    "of zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `eye(N)` function creates an $N \\times N$ two-dimensional identity\n",
    "matrix with ones along the diagonal:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [55]: eye(4)\n",
    "Out[55]: array([[ 1., 0., 0., 0.],\n",
    "                [ 0., 1., 0., 0.],\n",
    "                [ 0., 0., 1., 0.],\n",
    "                [ 0., 0., 0., 1.]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional arrays can also be created from one-dimensional arrays\n",
    "using the `reshape` function. For example, a $2 \\times 3$ array can be\n",
    "created as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [56]: c = arange(6)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [57]: c\n",
    "Out[57]: array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",

    "Out[59]: array([[0, 1, 2],\n",
    "                [3, 4, 5]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing multidimensional arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The individual elements of arrays can be accessed in the same way as for\n",
    "lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [60]: b[0][2]\n",
    "Out[60]: 5.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the syntax\n",

    "``` ipython\n",
    "In [61]: b[0,2]\n",
    "Out[61]: 5.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "syntax work for NumPy arrays and mean exactly the same thing; for lists\n",

    "-   **The elements of a NumPy array must all be of the same type**,\n",
    "    whereas the elements of a Python list can be of completely different\n",

    "-   **NumPy arrays support \"vectorized\" operations** like\n",
    "    element-by-element addition and multiplication. This is made\n",
    "    possible, in part, by the fact that all elements of the array have\n",
    "    the same type, which allows array operations like element-by-element\n",
