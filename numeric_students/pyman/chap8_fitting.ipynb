    "\n",
    "To illustrate this approach, let's consider some experimental data taken\n",
    "from a radioactive source that was emitting beta particles (electrons).\n",
    "We notice that the number of electrons emitted per unit time is\n",
    "decreasing with time. Theory suggests that the number of electrons $N$\n",
    "emitted per unit time should decay exponentially according to the\n",
    "equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau} \\;.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is nonlinear in $t$ and in the fitting parameter $\\tau$\n",
    "and thus cannot be fit using the method of the previous chapter.\n",
    "Fortunately, this is a special case for which the fitting function can\n",
    "be transformed into a linear form. Doing so will allow us to use the\n",
    "fitting routine we developed for fitting linear functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin our analysis by transforming our fitting function to a linear\n",
    "form. To this end we take the logarithm of Eq. `eq:decay`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ln N = \\ln N_{0} -\\frac{t}{\\tau} \\;.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With this tranformation our fitting function is linear in the\n",
    "independent variable $t$. To make our method work, however, our fitting\n",
    "function must be linear in the *fitting parameters*, and our transformed\n",
    "function is still nonlinear in the fitting parameters $\\tau$ and $N_0$.\n",
    "Therefore, we define new fitting parameters as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "a &= \\ln N_{0}\\\\\n",
    "b &= -1/\\tau\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we define a new dependent variable $y = \\ln N$, then our fitting\n",
    "function takes the form of a fitting function that is linear in the\n",
    "fitting parameters $a$ and $b$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = a + bx$$\n",

    "We are almost ready to fit our transformed fitting function, with\n",
    "transformed fitting parameters $a$ and $b$, to our transformed\n",
    "independent and dependent data, $x$ and $y$. The last thing we have to\n",
    "do is to transform the estimates of the uncertainties $\\delta N$ in $N$\n",
    "to the uncertainties $\\delta y$ in $y$ $(= \\ln N)$. So how much does a\n",
    "given uncertainty in $N$ translate into an uncertainty in $y$? In most\n",
    "cases, the uncertainty in $y$ is much smaller than $y$, *i.e.*\n",
    "$\\delta y \\ll y$; similarly $\\delta N \\ll N$. In this limit we can use\n",

    "produces a small change $\\delta y$ in $y$. Here we identify the\n",
    "differentials $dy$ and $dN$ with the uncertainties $\\delta y$ and\n",
    "$\\delta N$. Therefore, an uncertainty of $\\delta N$ in $N$ corresponds,\n",
    "or translates, to an uncertainty $\\delta y$ in $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize what we have done so far. We started with the some data\n",
    "points $\\{t_i,N_i\\}$ and some addition data $\\{\\delta N_i\\}$ where each\n",

    "\n",
    "$$N(t) = N_0 e^{-t/\\tau} \\;.$$\n",
