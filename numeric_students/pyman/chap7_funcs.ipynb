    "Python as well as in NumPy and Matplotlib. The main difference is that\n",

    "### Fast array processing in user-defined functions\n",
    "\n",
    "While using loops to process arrays works just fine, it is usually not\n",
    "the best way to accomplish the task in Python. The reason is that loops\n",
    "in Python are executed rather slowly. To deal with this problem, the\n",
    "developers of NumPy introduced a number of functions designed to process\n",
    "arrays quickly and efficiently. For the present case, what we need is a\n",
    "conditional statement or function that can process arrays directly. The\n",
    "function we want is called `where` and it is a part of the NumPy\n",
    "library. There `where` function has the form\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "where(condition, output if True, output if False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument of the `where` function is a conditional statement\n",
    "involving an array. The `where` function applies the condition to the\n",
    "array element by element, and returns the second argument for those\n",
    "array elements for which the condition is `True`, and returns the third\n",
    "argument for those array elements that are `False`. We can apply it to\n",
    "the `sinc(x)` function as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def sinc(x):\n",
    "    z = np.where(x==0.0, 1.0, np.sin(x)/x)\n",
    "    return z\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `where` function creates the array `y` and sets the elements of `y`\n",
    "equal to 1.0 where the corresponding elements of `x` are zero, and\n",
    "otherwise sets the corresponding elements to `sin(x)/x`. This code\n",
    "executes much faster, 25 to 100 times, depending on the size of the\n",
    "array, than the code using a `for` loop. Moreover, the new code is much\n",
    "simpler to write and read. An additional benefit of the `where` function\n",
    "is that it can handle single variables and arrays equally well. The code\n",
    "we wrote for the sinc function with the `for` loop cannot handle single\n",
    "variables. Of course we could rewrite the code so that it did, but the\n",
    "code becomes even more clunky. It's better just to use NumPy's `where`\n",
    "function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The moral of the story\n",
    "\n",
    "The moral of the story is that you should avoid using `for` and `while`\n",
    "loops to process arrays in Python programs whenever an array-processing\n",
    "method is available. As a beginning Python programmer, you may not\n",
    "always see how to avoid loops, and indeed, avoiding them is not always\n",
    "possible, but you should look for ways to avoid loops, especially loops\n",
    "that iterate a large number of times. As you become more experienced,\n",
    "you will find that using array-processing methods in Python becomes more\n",
    "natural. Using them can greatly speed up the execution of your code,\n",
    "especially when working with large arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "single: functions; multiple inputs and/or outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with more (or less) than one input or output\n",
    "\n",
    "Python functions can have any number of input arguments and can return\n",
    "any number of variables. For example, suppose you want a function that\n",
    "outputs $n$ $(x,y)$ coordinates around a circle of radius $r$ centered\n",
    "at the point $(x_0,y_0)$. The inputs to the function would be $r$,\n",
    "$x_0$, $y_0$, and $n$. The outputs would be the $n$ $(x,y)$ coordinates.\n",
    "The following code implements this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def circle(r, x0, y0, n):\n",
    "    theta = np.linspace(0., 2.*np.pi, n, endpoint=False)\n",
    "    x = r * np.cos(theta)\n",
    "    y = r * np.sin(theta)\n",
    "    return x0+x, y0+y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function has four inputs and two outputs. In this case, the four\n",
    "inputs are simple numeric variables and the two outputs are NumPy\n",
    "arrays. In general, the inputs and outputs can be any combination of\n",
    "data types: arrays, lists, strings, *etc*. Of course, the body of the\n",
    "function must be written to be consistent with the prescribed data\n",
    "types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can also return nothing to the calling program but just\n",
    "perform some task. For example, here is a program that clears the\n",
    "terminal screen\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import subprocess\n",
    "import platform\n",
    "\n",

    "    subprocess.Popen( \"cls\" if platform.system() == \n",
    "                      \"Windows\" else \"clear\", shell=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is invoked by typing `clear()`. It has no inputs and no\n",
    "outputs but it performs a useful task. This function uses two standard\n",
    "Python libraries, `subprocess` and `platform` that are useful for\n",
    "performing computer system tasks. It's not important that you know\n",
    "anything about them at this point. We simply use them here to\n",
    "demonstrate a useful cross-platform function that has no inputs and\n",
    "returns no values.\n",

    "single: functions; arguments; keyword single: functions; arguments;\n",

    "\n",
    "### Positional and keyword arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often useful to have function arguments that have some default\n",
    "setting. This happens when you want an input to a function to have some\n",
    "standard value or setting most of the time, but you would like to\n",
    "reserve the possibility of giving it some value other than the default\n",
    "value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the program `circle` from the previous section, we might\n",
    "decide that under most circumstances, we want `n=12` points around the\n",
    "circle, like the points on a clock face, and we want the circle to be\n",
    "centered at the origin. In this case, we would rewrite the code to read\n",

    "\n",
    "The default values of the arguments `x0`, `y0`, and `n` are specified in\n",
    "the argument of the function definition in the `def` line. Arguments\n",
    "whose default values are specified in this manner are called *keyword\n",
    "arguments*, and they can be omitted from the function call if the user\n",
    "is content using those values. For example, writing `circle(4)` is now a\n",
    "perfectly legal way to call the `circle` function and it would produce\n",
    "12 $(x,y)$ coordinates centered about the origin $(x,y)=(0,0)$. On the\n",
    "other hand, if you want the values of `x0`, `y0`, and `n` to be\n",

    "values as you would have before.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change only some of the keyword arguments, you can do so\n",
    "by using the keywords in the function call. For example, suppose you are\n",
    "content with have the circle centered on $(x,y)=(0,0)$ but you want only\n",
    "6 points around the circle rather than 12. Then you would call the\n",
    "`circle` function as follows:\n",

    "Let's start with the NumPy array. A NumPy array is a Python object and\n",

    "array of 10 uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 1. An\n",
