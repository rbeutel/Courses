    "\n",
    "This text provides an introduction to Python for science and engineering\n",
    "applications but is hardly exhaustive. There are many other resources\n",
    "that you will want to tap. Here I point out several that you may find\n",
    "useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web resources\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The best web resource for Python is a good search engine like Google.\n",
    "Nevertheless, I list a few web sites here that you might find useful. I\n",
    "have successfully resisted any attempt to be exhaustive so that the list\n",
    "is actually useful. Nevertheless, if you find a really cool site that\n",
    "you think should be on this list, please let me know.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <http://www.python.org/>  \n",
    "> The official Python web site. I almost never look here.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <http://docs.python.org/3/reference/>  \n",
    "> Sometimes I look here for detailed information about Python 3, which\n",
    "> is the version used in this manual. Documentation for the previous\n",
    "> version, Python 2, is available at\n",
    "> <http://docs.python.org/2/reference/>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/>  \n",
    "> I usually start here when I need information about NumPy. It has links\n",
    "> to just about all the NumPy documentation I need. By the way, I say\n",
    "> \"num-pee\", which rhymes with \"bumpy\"---a lot of people say \"num-pie\",\n",
    "> which doesn't sound like English to me.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/>  \n",
    "> I start here when I need information about SciPy, its various packages\n",
    "> and their functions. I say \"psy-pi\" for SciPy, like everyone else. Who\n",
    "> says I have to be consistent? (see Emerson)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html>  \n",
    "> The *Plotting Commands Summary* page for MatPlotLib. It has a search\n",
    "> feature and links to all the MatPlotLib documentation, which I use a\n",
    "> lot. You can go the the main MatPlotLib page,\n",
    "> <http://matplotlib.org/>, but frankly, it's less useful. The site\n",
    "> <http://www.loria.fr/~rougier/teaching/matplotlib/> is also useful for\n",
    "> learning some MatPlotLib tricks.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <http://ipython.org/>  \n",
    "> I go to this page mostly to learn about IPython Notebook\n",
    "> (<http://ipython.org/notebook.html>) but it's also useful if you need\n",
    "> information about the IPython interpreter, especially if you want to\n",
    "> find out more about IPython magic commands.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> <http://scipy-lectures.github.io/>  \n",
    "> This link provides a web-based quick introduction to scientific Python\n",
    "> that assumes you have some experience programming (not necessarily in\n",
    "> Python). It's terser than my introduction, but covers some useful\n",
    "> topics that I do not cover.\n",

    "people. It doesn't have anything special for scientific programming, and\n",
    "thus does not cover the NumPy, SciPy, or MatPlotLib packages, but for\n",
    "just about everything else, it's an excellent resource. It gives a good\n",
    "introduction to object oriented programming, or OOP, which I say little\n",
    "about in this text. The 3rd edition of the book covers Python 2 while\n",
    "the 4th and 5th (current) editions cover Python 3. You are probably\n",
    "better off getting the latest edition as everybody will soon be using\n",
    "Python 3. If you are using Python 2, as we do in this text, you can\n",
    "easily enough figure out the differences between Python 3 and 2."
