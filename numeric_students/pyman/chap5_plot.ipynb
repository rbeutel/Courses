    "\n",
    "The graphical representation of data---plotting---is one of the most\n",
    "important tools for evaluating and understanding scientific data and\n",
    "theoretical predictions. However, plotting is not a part of core Python\n",
    "but is provided through one of several possible library modules. The\n",
    "most highly developed and widely used plotting package for Python is\n",
    "MatPlotLib (<http://MatPlotLib.sourceforge.net/>). It is a powerful and\n",
    "flexible program that has become the *de facto* standard for 2-d\n",
    "plotting with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because MatPlotLib is an external library---in fact it's a collection of\n",
    "libraries---it must be imported into any routine that uses it.\n",
    "MatPlotLib makes extensive use of NumPy so the two should be imported\n",
    "together. Therefore, for any program for which you would like to produce\n",
    "2-d plots, you should include the lines\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other MatPlotLib sub-libraries, but the `pyplot` library\n",
    "provides nearly everything that you need for 2-d plotting. The standard\n",
    "prefix for it is `plt`. The two statements above must appear before any\n",
    "calls to NumPy or MatPlotLib routines are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "One final word before we get started: We only scratch the surface of\n",
    "what is possible using MatPlotLib and as you become familiar with it,\n",
    "you will surely want to do more than this manual describes. In that\n",
    "case, you need to go the the web to get more information. A good place\n",
    "to start is <http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html>. Another\n",
    "interesting web page is <http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html>.\n",

    "A window should appear with a plot that looks something like the\n",
    "`fig-zigzagPlotDemo` shown here. By default, the `plot` function draws a\n",
    "line between the data points that were entered. You can save this plot\n",
    "to an image file by clicking on the floppy disk icon at the top of the\n",
    "plot window. You can also zoom, pan, scroll through the plot, and return\n",

    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where `x` and `y` are arrays (or lists) that have the same size. If the\n",
    "`x` array is missing, that is, if there is only a single array, as in\n",
    "our example above, the `plot` function uses `0, 1, ..., N-1` for the `x`\n",
    "array, where `N` is the size of the `y` array. Thus, the `plot` function\n",
    "provides a quick graphical way of examining a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "More typically, you supply both an $x$ and a $y$ data set to plot.\n",
    "Taking things a bit further, you may also want to plot several data sets\n",
    "on the same graph, use symbols as well as lines, label the axes, create\n",
    "a title and a legend, and control the color of symbols and lines. All of\n",
    "this is possible but requires calling a number of plotting functions.\n",
    "For this reason, plotting is usually done using a Python script or\n",
    "program.\n",

    "Basic plotting\n",

    "\n",
    "single: plots; basic\n",

    "The quickest way to learn how to plot using the MatPlotLib library is by\n",
    "example. For our first task, let's plot the sine function over the\n",
    "interval from 0 to $4\\pi$. The main plotting function `plot` in\n",
    "MatPlotLib does not plot functions *per se*, it plots $(x,y)$ data\n",
    "points. As we shall see, we can instruct the function `plot` either to\n",
    "just draw point---or dots---at each data point, or we can instruct it to\n",
    "draw straight lines between the data points. To create the illusion of\n",
    "the smooth function that the sine function is, we need to create enough\n",
    "$(x,y)$ data points so that when `plot` draws straight lines between the\n",
    "data points, the function appears to be smooth. The sine function\n",
    "undergoes two full oscillations with two maxima and two minima between 0\n",
    "and $4\\pi$. So let's start by creating an array with 33 data points\n",
    "between 0 and $4\\pi$, and then let MatPlotLib draw a straight line\n",
    "between them. Our code consists of four parts\n",
    "\n",
    "-   import the NumPy and MatPlotLib modules (lines 1-2 below)\n",
    "-   create the $(x,y)$ data arrays (lines 3-4 below)\n",
    "-   have `plot` draw straight lines between the $(x,y)$ data points\n",
    "    (line 5 below)\n",
    "-   display the plot in a figure window using the `show` function (line\n",
    "    6 below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our code, which consists of only 6 lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "x = np.linspace(0, 4.*np.pi, 33)\n",
    "y = np.sin(x)\n",

    "Only 6 lines suffice to create the plot, which consists of the sine\n",
    "function over the interval from 0 to $4\\pi$, as advertised, as well as\n",
    "axes annotated with nice whole numbers over the appropriate interval.\n",
    "It's a pretty nice plot made with very little code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One problem, however, is that while the plot oscillates like a sine\n",
    "wave, it is not smooth. This is because we did not create the $(x,y)$\n",
    "arrays with enough data points. To correct this, we need more data\n",
    "points. The plot below was created using the same program shown above\n",
    "but with 129 $(x,y)$ data points instead of 33. Try it out your self by\n",
    "copying the above program and replacing 33 in line 3 with 129 so that\n",

    "The code above illustrates how plots can be made with very little code\n",
    "using the MatPlotLib module. In making this plot, MatPlotLib has made a\n",
    "number of choices, such as the size of the figure, the blue color of the\n",
    "line, even the fact that by default a line is drawn between successive\n",
    "data points in the $(x,y)$ arrays. All of these choices can be changed\n",
    "by explicitly instructing MatPlotLib to do so. This involves including\n",

    "\n",
    "When plotting experimental data it is customary to include error bars\n",
    "that indicate graphically the degree of uncertainty that exists in the\n",
    "measurement of each data point. The MatPlotLib function `errorbar` plots\n",
    "data with error bars attached. It can be used in a way that either\n",

    "When error bars are desired, you typically replace the `plot` function\n",

    "function are the `x` and `y` arrays to be plotted, just as for the\n",
    "`plot` function. The keyword `fmt` *must be used* to specify the format\n",
    "of the points to be plotted; the format specifiers are the same as for\n",
    "`plot`. The keywords `xerr` and `yerr` are used to specify the $x$ and\n",
    "$y$ error bars. Setting one or both of them to a constant specifies one\n",
    "size for all the error bars. Alternatively, setting one or both of them\n",
    "equal to an array that has the same length as the `x` and `y` arrays\n",
    "allows you to give each data point an error bar with a different value.\n",
    "If you only want $y$ error bars, then you should only specify the `yerr`\n",

    "of 0.75, meaning that the error bars extend 0.75 to the left and 0.75 to\n",
    "the right of each data point. The $y$ error bars are set equal to an\n",
